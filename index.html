      Hi, I'm Sage. This is my site. Not sure what to really do with this.

      The impotus for this is to have a website when employers ask if I have a website. Now I can point and say I do.
      But, now there's a problem. Linking a Github Pages site to my portfolio and NOT having a lot in my portfolio is... problematic.
      Especially in today's market.

      So, I think my goal for this site will be the following. I'll leverage tailwind css, since github pages is a flat representation of modern web.
      I definitely wish I was part of that era.

      Second, I'll flesh out pages to be a portfolio / who am i / I'm a real person please hire me. 
      Will focus on showing off what I have done, from Vercel published mini-sites to... well, everything that I think will make me more marketable in front end space.

      But step one will be making this site, some landing page with tailwind css styling.
